### Transferring Files to Target Systems

+ After obtaining initial access to a target system, you will need to transfer files to the target system.

+ In some cases, you will not have access to the target system via a `Meterpreter` session, and as a result, you will need to use the inbuilt OS specific utilities to facilitate the transfer of files from your system to the target system.

+ This process utilizes a two-step approach, where you will need to host the files you want to transfer on a web server and download the files hosted on the web server to the target system.

### Python web server for file transfer

+ Python comes with a built-in module known as SimpleHTTPServer(python2) and http.server (python3), that can be used to facilitate a simple HTTP server that gives you standard GET and HEAD request handlers.

+ This module can be used to host files in any directory of your system. And can be implemented through a single command in your terminal.

- We can use this command to host the `pwd` in the web server.
```
python -m http.server 8080
```
