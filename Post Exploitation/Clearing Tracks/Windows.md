### Clearing your tracks on Windows

+ The exploitation and post-exploitation phases of a penetration test involves actively engaging with target systems and the data that is stored on these systems.

+ As a result, you may be required to clear/undo any changes you have made to the target systems you have compromised based on the guidelines specified in the rules of engagement.

+ If you have transferred any files to the target systems you have compromised, keep track of where they have been saved so that you can remove them when done.

+ A good practice is to store all your scripts, exploits and binaries in the `C:/Temp` directory on Windows and the `/tmp` directory on Linux.

+ It is also important to consider the exploitation framework you are using, an example of this is MSF, which is notorious for generating and storing artifacts on the target system when using exploit or post modules.

+ Some well designed MSF modules provide you with instructions and resource scripts that provide you with information regarding where the artifacts are stored and how they can be removed.

+ In the context of Windows, a typical post-exploitation technique pertinent to clearing your tracks is to delete the Windows Event Log. This is something that should be avoided during a penetration test as the Windows Event Log stores a lot of data that is important to the client you are performing the penetration test for.

### How to clear tracks on Windows ?

1. Exploit the target system and gain initial access.

2. Its's always recommended to remove the artefacts post exploitation. We should always upload any binary to the `Temp` directory so that we can easily locate and delete it later on.

3. In our case, we'll be using the `persistence_service` module. This module uploads an `exe` to the target system for persistence access. Since this module is well developed, it also provides us with the path to the `exe` file it saved on the system and a `.rc` resource script file for clearing tracks. 

4. In order to use the resource script, we can exit out of the `meterpreter` shell and use the following command.
```
resource <path-to-resource-script>
```

5. We can check whether the file has been deleted successfully by checking the Temp directory. `C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp`.

6. `Meterpreter` also comes with a module to clear the event logs of the system. Although, clearing event logs is not recommended during a penetration test. `clearev`.
