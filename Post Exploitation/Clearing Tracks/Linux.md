### How to clear tracks on Linux ?

1. Exploit the target and gain initial access. 

2. Whenever transferring files to a Linux system, we should always upload it to the `/tmp` directory, located under the `/` root directory. 

3. The contents of the `tmp` directory gets deleted automatically after a certain period of time.

4. On most Linux systems we would typically find a hidden bash history `.bash_history` file inside the home directory which would store the history of commands typed on the terminal. This is typically used as a security mechanism by system admins to monitor user activity. We can overwrite the contents of the file using `echo`.
```
echo "1 <random-fake-command>" > .bash_history
```

6. We can use the `history` command to check the list of commands that the user has typed in the current session. It can be cleared using `history -c`.
