### Misconfigured SUDO Privileges

1. Identify the commands we can run as the current unprivileged user using the `sudo -l` command. 

2. In our case, the `man` utility (command manual) can be run as `root` with no password as an unprivileged user. Although this misconfiguration may seem harmless, but this allows an unprivileged user to spawn a bash session from within the utility. 

3. To exploit this we can run the `man` utility with `sudo` privileges. 
```
sudo man ls
```

4. After running, we can insert the code `!/bin/bash` in the manual. Typing `!` allows us to start typing inside the manual.  Since `man` is running with `sudo` privileges, whatever code we'll type and execute from within `man` should be executed with root privileges. In this case, we should obtain a bash session with root privileges.
