### What is Port Forwarding ?

+ Port forwarding is the process of redirecting traffic from a specific port on a target system to a specific port on our system.

+ In the context of pivoting, we can forward a remote port on a previously inaccessible host to a local port on our Kali Linux system so that we can remotely interact/exploit the service running on the port.
