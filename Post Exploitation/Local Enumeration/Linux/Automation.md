### Automating Linux Local Enumeration 

+ In addition to performing local enumeration manually, we can also automate the process with the help of a few scripts and `MSF` modules.

+ While local enumeration techniques/commands are important to know, as a penetration tester, you will need to be time efficient. As a result, you will need to learn how to utilize various automated enumeration scripts.

+ In addition to automating the process of enumerating information like system information, users & groups etc, these automated enumeration scripts will also provide you with additional information regarding the target system like; privilege escalation vulnerabilities, locally stored passwords etc. 

### Linux Local Enumeration Scripts

+ `LinEnum` - LinEnum is a simple bash script that automates common Linux local enumeration checks in addition to identifying privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

### Enumerate using `MSF`

1. Gain initial access.

2. Using `enum_configs` module to gather Linux configs.
```
use post/linux/gather/enum_configs
```

3. Using `enum_network` to gather network info
```
use post/linux/gather/enum_network
```

4. Using `enum_system` to gather system and user info
```
use post/linux/gather/enum_system
```

5. Using `checkvm` module for Linux to detect whether the system is running in a VM
```
use post/linux/gather/checkvm
```

### How to use `LinEnum` script ?

1. Navigate to the `/tmp` directory.

2. Go to the official `LinEnum` Github repository and copy the `LinEnum.sh` bash code. 

3. Switch back to the attack machine, paste the copied code in a text file and save it with a `.sh` extension and a name of your choice.  

4. Upload the `.sh` bash script in the `/tmp` directory using the `meterpreter` shell.

5. Open a bash command shell session in the target system and give the `LinEnum` script which we uploaded executable permissions using `chmod +x`. 

6. Run the script. This should automate all the enumeration processes which we were performing using `MSF`.
