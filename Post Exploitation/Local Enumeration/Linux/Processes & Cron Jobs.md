### Enumerating running processes and cron jobs

+ After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like, what processes, services and scheduled tasks are currently running.

+ What are we looking for?
	+ Running services
	+ Cron Jobs

### How to enumerate ?

1. Gain initial access. 

2. We look at the list of `meterpreter` shell system commands we can run on the target system using `?`. 

3. We can use the `ps` command in the target shell, this will show us the process list.

4. We can also use the `ps aux` command to show all the details of the running processes such as CPU and memory consumption.

5. The `top` command will open a dynamic process list like task manager. 

6. Use `crontab -l` to check the list of cron jobs. We can also use `ls -la /etc/cron*` to look for all the files with `cron` in their file name.
