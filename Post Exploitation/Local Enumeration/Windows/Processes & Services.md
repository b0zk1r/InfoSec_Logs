### Enumerating Processes & Services

+ After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like, what processes, services and scheduled tasks are currently running.

+ What are we looking for?
	+ Running processes & services
	+ Scheduled tasks

=> A process is an instance of a running executable (.exe) or program.

=> A service is a process which runs in the background and does not interact with the desktop.

### How to enumerate ?

1. After gaining initial access, we can use the `ps` command in the meterpreter shell to get the list of the running processes in the target system. Alternatively, we can also use the `pgrep <process-name>` command to check the PID of a particular process. 

2. We can use the `net start` command to get the list of background services that are started. We can also use `wmic service list brief` command to get the same including the status of the services. 

3. We can use `tasklist /SVC` command to get the list of processes running and also the services working under it. 

4. We can check the list of scheduled tasks in the system.
```
schtasks /query /fo LIST /V
```
