### Enumerating Network Information

+ What are we looking for?
	+ Current IP address & network adapter
	+ Internal networks
	+ TCP/UDP services running and their respective ports
	+ Other hosts on the network
	+ Routing table
	+ Windows Firewall state

### How to enumerate ?

1. Gain initial access.

2. Use `ipconfig` in the command shell to get info about the network adaptors. We can get additional info about the adaptors using `ipconfig /all`.

3. We can also check out the routing table using `route print`. 

4. To get the list of other devices on the network we can use `arp -a`.

5. If we want to see the list of services running on the system and their status, we can use `netstat -ano`.  This will display the local address of the services and the ports they are running on.

6. We can check the Windows firewall configuration state.
```
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
```
