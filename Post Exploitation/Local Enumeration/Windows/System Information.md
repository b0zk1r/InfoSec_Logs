### Enumerating System Information

+ After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like, what OS is running as well as the OS version. This information is very useful as it gives us an idea of what we can do and what type of exploits we can run.

+ What are we looking for?
	+ Hostname
	+ OS Name (Windows 7, 8 etc)
	+ OS Build & Service Pack (Windows 7 SP1 7600)
	+ OS Architecture (x64/x86)
	+ Installed updates/Hotfixes

### How to perform Windows Local Enumeration ?

1. After gaining initial access to the target system, we can go ahead and use commands like `systeminfo` inside the target's command shell. This will provide us with a lot of information regarding the target.

2. We can also use `wmic` to enumerate info about the updates installed.
```
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
```
- This enumerate a list of installed updates in addition to the HotFix URLs. Since we are performing a penetration test, we are looking for security updates. 

3. The contents of the `eula.txt` file should also contain information pertinent to the Windows version. 
```
cat C:\\Windows\System32\eula.txt
```
