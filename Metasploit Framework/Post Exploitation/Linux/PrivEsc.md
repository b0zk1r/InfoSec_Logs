+ The privilege escalation techniques we can utilize will depend on the version of the Linux kernel running on the target system as well as the distribution release version.

+ MSF offers very little in regards to Linux kernel exploit modules, however, in some cases, there may be an exploit module that can be utilized to exploit a vulnerable service or program in order to elevate our privileges.

### How to perform ?

1. Gain initial access, in our case we are exploiting SSH to gain access using the `ssh_login`module.

2. We can now upgrade the session to a meterpreter session. `session -u 1`

3. In order to identify a vulnerable process or service, we can check the running processes with `ps aux` in the command `shell`.

4. In our case, we can see that the user has run a script `check-down`. We check the contents of the script, and the script is executing a binary `chkrootkit`.

5. `chkrootkit` is a binary used to scan a Linux OS for root-kits. The `chkrootkit v4.9` is vulnerable in our case. We'll use the `MSF` exploit module to exploit `chkrootkit` and escalate our privileges.
```
use exploit/unix/local/chkrootkit
```
- This will use cron jobs to execute a malicious binary to elevate privileges.
