+ The Windows OS stores and catalogs all actions/events performed on the system and stores them in the Windows Event log.

+ Event logs are categorized based on the type of events they store:
	+ Application logs: Stores application/program events like startups, crashes etc.
	+ System logs: Stores system events like startups, reboots etc.
	+ Security logs: Stores security events like password changes, authentication failures etc.

+ Event logs can be accessed via the Event Viewer on Windows.

+ The event logs are the first stop for any forensic investigator after a compromise has been detected. It is therefore very important to clear your tracks after you are done with your assessment. 

- We can delete the event logs with `clearev` command. This will clear all the event logged in the target system.
