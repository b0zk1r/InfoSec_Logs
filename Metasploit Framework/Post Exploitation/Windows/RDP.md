### What is RDP ?

+ The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary GUI remote access protocol developed by Microsoft and is used to remotely connect and interact with a Windows system.

+ RDP uses TCP port 3389 by default.

+ RDP is disabled by default, however, we can utilize an MSF exploit module to enable RDP on the Windows target and consequently utilize RDP to remotely access to the target system.

+ RDP authentication requires a legitimate user account on the target system as well as the user's password in clear-text.

### How to exploit ?

1. Gain initial access.

2. Using `enable_rdp` post exploitation module.
```
use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp
```
- This will check whether RDP is enabled or not.

3. We can now change the administrator password, although it isn't recommended as it'll be a clear indicator of system compromise. We need to have elevated privileges in-order to change the password.
```
net user administrator <new-pass>
```

4. We can now use `xfreerdp` to login using RDP.
```
xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:<password> /v:<target-ip>
```
