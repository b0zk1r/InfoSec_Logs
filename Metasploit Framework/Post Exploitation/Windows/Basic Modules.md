+ The MSF provides us with various post exploitation modules for both Windows and Linux.
+ We can utilize these post exploitation modules to enumerate information about the Windows system we currently have access to:
	+ Enumerate user privileges
	+ Enumerate logged on users
	+ VM check
	+ Enumerate installed programs
	+ Enumerate AVs
	+ Enumerate computers connected to domain
	+ Enumerate installed patches
	+ Enumerate shares 

### How to perform it ?

1. Use `getsystem` command to elevate privileges using basic techniques.

2. We can also `migrate` to different process. The `migrate` command uses the module `post/windows/manage/migrate`.

3. We can enumerate the privileges of the current user using `win_privs` module.
```
use post/windows/gather/win_privs
```

4. We can check what users are currently logged on or had recently logged on.
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
```

5. We can check if the target is a virtual machine or not.``
```
use post/windows/gather/checkvm
```

6. We can check the programs that are installed in the target systrem.
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_applications
```

7. Enumerate the folders that are excluded from scanning by Windows Defender.
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_av_excluded
```
- These excluded folders can be used to store our payloads on the target machine.

8. Check if the target system is part of a domain.
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_computers
```

9. Enumerating the applied patches in the target system.
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_patches
```

10. We can enumerate the shares in the target system.
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_shares
```

11. Enabling RDP in the system.
```
use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp
```
