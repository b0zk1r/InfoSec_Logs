### What is the `incognito` module ?

+ Incognito is a built-in `meterpreter` module that was originally a standalone application that allows you to impersonate user tokens after successful exploitation.

+ We can use the incognito module to display a list of available tokens that we can impersonate.

### How to use ?

1. Gain initial access.

2. Check if the current user has `SeImpersonateTokenPrivilege` as it is essential for performing a Token Impersonation attack.

3. Load the `incognito` module. 
```
load incognito
```

4. We can list out the tokens using `list_tokens -u`. The tokens will be divided into Delegation and Impersonation tokens.

5. If an administrator token is available, we can use it to impersonate. 
```
impersonate_token "TOKEN_NAME"
```
