### What is Keylogging ?

+ Keylogging is the process of recording or capturing the keystrokes entered on a target system.

+ This technique is not limited to post exploitation, there are plenty of programs and USB devices that can be used to capture and transmit the keystrokes entered on a system.

+ Meterpreter on a Windows system provides us with the ability to capture the keystrokes entered on a target system and download them back to our local system.

### How to perform ?

1. Gain initial access. 

2. Inside our meterpreter shell, we can use command `keyscan_start` to start our keystroke sniffer. We can stop it using `keyscan_stop`.

3. To dump the recorded keystrokes, we can use command `keyscan_dump`.
