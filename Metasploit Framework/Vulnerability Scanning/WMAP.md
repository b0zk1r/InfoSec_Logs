+ `WMAP` is a powerful, feature-rich web application vulnerability scanner that can be used to automate web server enumeration and scan web applications for vulnerabilities.

+ `WMAP` is available as an `MSF` plugin and can be loaded directly into `MSF`.

+ `WMAP` is fully integrated with `MSF`, which consequently allows us to perform web app vulnerability scanning from within the `MSF`.

- It utilises the in-built `metasploit` auxiliary modules to perform a scan.

### How to use ?

1. Start `postgresql` service and `msfconsole`. 

2. Load the `WMAP` module. `load wmap`.

3. We can see the various `wmap` modules by using command `wmap_`.

4. Add a `wmap` site.
```
wmap_sites -a <ip-addr>
```

5. Add the target URL on which we want to perform a vulnerability scan on. 
```
wmap_targets -t http://<ip>
```

6. We can check the sites that have been added using `wmap_sites -l`. We can also do the same for `wmap_targets`.

7. Use command `wmap_run -t` to show all enabled modules. This will display all the auxiliary modules that'll be used to perform the vulnerability scan.

8. We can then use command `wmap_run -e` to start the vulnerability scan. This will use all the enabled modules to perform the scan. 

9. We can also list out the vulnerabilities `wmap` was able to find using `wmap_vulns -l`.

10. It'll also show us the `http` methods that are allowed by the web server. If PUT and POST methods are allowed we can potentially upload malicious files in the web server. We can use a `MSF` auxiliary module for this. 
```
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put
```
