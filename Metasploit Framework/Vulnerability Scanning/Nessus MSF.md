+ `Nessus` is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable. 

+ We can utilize `Nessus` to perform a vulnerability scan on a target system, after which, we can import the `Nessus` results in to `MSF` for analysis and exploitation. 

+ `Nessus` automates the process of identifying vulnerabilities and also provides us with information pertinent to a vulnerability like the CVE code. 

+ We can use the free version of Nessus (Nessus Essentials), which allows us to scan upto 16 IPs. 

- After installation, it'll run on our localhost on port 8834.

### How to use ?

1. Select Basic Network Scan from the scan menu. Configure the settings and launch the scan.

2. After the scan is done, we can go to the vulnerabilities tab, click the Filter option and set the filter to `Metasploit Exploit Framework` and set its value to `true`. This will help us filter out the vulnerabilities for which the exploits are available in `MSF`.

3. Similarly, we can set the filter to `severity` and set it to `High` to only show vulnerabilities with `High` severity. 

4. We can now export the report. Click on the `Export` drop-down menu and click `Nessus`. This should save the file in the specified location.

5. We can now start `msfconsole` and create a workspace. 

6. Import the Nessus scan results.
```
db_import <path_to_file>
```

7. We can now check if the scan results have been successfully imported by using command `hosts`. This should display the IP address scanned by Nessus.

8. We can also use `services` command to check the list of services scanned by Nessus.

9. We can use `vulns` command to check the vulnerabilities found respective to the target's ports and services.
	+ We can also use the `-p` command to specify a particular port. `vulns -p <port>

10. We can use the `search` command to search for a particular CVE or MS vulnerability identifier.
	+ We can `search` for CVEs of a particular year. `search cve:2017`
