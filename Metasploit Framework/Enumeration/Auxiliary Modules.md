+ Auxiliary modules are used to perform functionality like scanning, discovery and fuzzing.

+ We can use auxiliary modules to perform both TCP & UDP port scanning as well as enumerating information from services like FTP, SSH, HTTP etc

+ Auxiliary modules can be used during the information gathering phase of a penetration test as well as the post exploitation phase.

+ We can also use auxiliary modules to discover hosts and perform port scanning on a different network subnet after we have obtained initial access on a target system. 

### Pivoting with `MSF` Basics

1. Start `msfconsole` with `postgresql` database service.

2. Create a new workspace.

3. Portscan with an auxiliary module.
```
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
```

4. In our case, port 80 is open, which indicates presence of a web server. 

5. We can use `curl` to see the `html` of the website. This way, we can potentially identify the service running in the web server. 

6. Search the service name, find the exploit module and exploit the web server. Use `/` (root) as the `TARGETURI` if asked.

7. After we get a `meterpreter` session, enter the `shell` session using `/bin/bash -i`.

8. Check the network information using `ifconfig`. We see that the target has another interface `eth1` and this has a totally different IP address, which indicates that it is part of a different subnet. 

9. Now that we have identified the subnet of this particular local network, we can add the route within `meterpreter`
```
run autoroute -s <ip-addr> 
```

- The `autoroute` command in Metasploit is used to manage the routing of traffic through a compromised system to reach other subnets or hosts. This can be especially useful when you have gained access to a network and want to pivot through the compromised system to reach other internal network segments.

10. We can now background the current session. To perform a port scan on the IP address which we just discovered. 

11. Since we have the route, we can perform a port scan through the first system we exploited. 

12. We can now type `back` to exit the module. And now use another module to perform an UDP scan.
```
use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/udp_sweep 
```
