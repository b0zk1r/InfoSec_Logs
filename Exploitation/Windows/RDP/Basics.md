###  What is RDP ?

- __The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)__ is a proprietary GUI remote access protocol developed by Microsoft and is used to remotely connect and interact with a Windows system.

* RDP uses TCP __port 3389__ by default, and can also be configured to run on any other TCP port.

- RDP authentication requires a legitimate user account on the target system as well as the userâ€™s password in clear-text.

- We can perform an RDP brute-force attack to identify legitimate user credentials that we can use to gain remote access to the target system.
