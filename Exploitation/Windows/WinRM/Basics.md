### What is WinRM ?

- Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a Windows remote management protocol that can be used to facilitate remote access with Windows systems over HTTP(S).

- Microsoft implemented WinRM in to Windows in order to make life easier for system administrators.

- WinRM is typically used in the following ways:
	+ Remotely access and interact with Windows hosts on a local network.
	+ Remotely access and execute commands on Windows systems.
	+ Manage and configure Windows systems remotely.

- WinRM typically uses TCP port __5985 and 5986 (HTTPS).__

### How can we exploit it ?

- WinRM implements access control and security for communication between systems through various forms of authentication.

- We can utilize a utility called “crackmapexec” to perform a brute-force on WinRM in order to identify users and their passwords as well as execute commands on the target system.

- We can also utilize a ruby script called “evil-winrm” to obtain a command shell session on the target system.
