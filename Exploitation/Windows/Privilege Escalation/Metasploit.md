### Using `MSF` to escalate privileges

- Check what are the privileges of the current user - `getprivs`
- In-built `meterpreter` command to elevate privileges - `getsystem`

### `MSF` module to suggest exploits

```
use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```

- Its a post exploitation module
- Set the `SESSION` to the which you want to escalate privileges on.
- This will enumerate all the vulnerabilities in this version of Windows and also suggest `MSF` modules that we can use to elevate the privileges.
- We can then Google the module names and select the that one suits us.
- Remember to set the `LPORT` in the selected module to a port number that isn't currently in use by any of the sessions.
