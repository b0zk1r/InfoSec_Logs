- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that uses TCP port 21 and is used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client/clients.

- It is also frequently used as a means of transferring files to and from the directory of a web server.

- FTP authentication requires a username and password combination. As a result, we can perform a brute-force attack on the FTP server in order to identify legitimate credentials.

- In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow anonymous access, which consequently allows anyone to access to the FTP server without providing any legitimate credentials. 

### Check for anonymous FTP login

1. Check if anonymous access is enabled. Login normally with `ftp <ip>` and put username as `anonymous`. If login fails, then anonymous login is disabled.

2. We can also run `NMAP` script `ftp-anon`.

### Bruteforcing FTP with `hydra`

```
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt <ip> -t 4 ftp
```

- We are limiting the threads to 4 with `-t` as FTP brute-forcing can potentially bring down the FTP server.
- We can login with the found credentials and download a file using `get <file>`.

__We can also look for service specific exploits by using `searchsploit`
