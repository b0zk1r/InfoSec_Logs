* SSH (Secure Shell) is a remote administration protocol that offers encryption and is the successor to Telnet.

- It is typically used for remote access to servers and systems.
 
- SSH uses TCP port 22 by default, however, like other services, it can be configured to use any other open TCP port.
 
- SSH authentication can be configured in two ways:
	+ Username & password authentication
	+ Key based authentication (Public/Private key)

* In the case of username and password authentication, we can perform a brute-force attack on the SSH server in order to identify legitimate credentials and consequently gain access to the target system. 

### Bruteforcing SSH with `hydra`

```
hydra -L <user-file> -P <pass-file> -t 4 <ip> ssh
```

### Logging in using `SSH`

```
ssh <user>@<ip>
```
- Now we can enumerate more users by using the command `cat /etc/passwd`
