+ Netcat (Aka TCP/IP Swiss Army Knife) is a networking utility used to read and write data to network connections using TCP or UDP.

+ Netcat is available for both NIX and Windows operating systems, consequently making it extremely useful for cross-platform engagements.

+ Netcat utilizes a client-server communication architecture with two modes:
	+ Client mode - Netcat can be used in client mode to connect to any TCP/UDP port as well as a Netcat listener (server).
	+ Server mode - Netcat can be used to listen for connections from clients on a specific port.
+ Netcat can be used by penetration testers to perform the following functionality:
	+ Banner Grabbing
	+ Port Scanning
	+ Transferring Files 
	+ Bind/Reverse Shells 

### How to use `netcat` ?

1. Use `nc --help` for help menu.

2. Connect to a target port using `nc`
```
nc -nv <ip> <port>
```
- `-n` - No DNS mode.
- `-v` - Increase verbosity.

3. We can use `-u` to connect to a UDP port or listen on it. 

### Connecting two hosts using `nc`

1. Hosting `nc.exe` file in our Linux system to transfer it to the Windows system. 
	+ Send the `nc.exe` file to our Windows machine. It is saved in the `/usr/share/windows-binaries/` directory. 
	+ Setup a file server using Python. Use `SimpleHTTPServer` in the directory.
	+ Navigate to the directory where we want to transfer the file to in our Windows system.
	+ Using `certuril` to install the `nc.exe` file in our Windows system. `certutil -urlcache -f http://<linux-IP>/nc.exe <save-as>.exe

2. Since the `nc.exe` file has been successfully transferred to the Windows system, we can proceed with setting up the `nc` listener in our Linux system.
```
nc -lnvp <port>
```
- `-l` - To setup listener
- `-p` - To specify the port to listen on. 

3. Once our `nc` listener has been started in the Linux system, we can use our Windows system to connect to it.
```
nc -nv <linux-IP>
```

4. Once we connect, we can check our listener in the Linux system, we should get a connection from the Windows system.

5. We can test the connection by sending messages to & fro the Linux and the Windows system by typing a message in the terminal where `nc` is running from any of the two host.

6. We can similarly setup the listener in the Windows system, connect using the Linux system and vice-versa. 

### Transferring files using `nc`

1. Start the listener in the system where we want to receive the file.
```
nc.exe -lnvp <port> > <save-as>.txt
```

2. Now, we'll host the file that we want to send using `nc` in Linux.
```
nc -nv <receiver-ip> <port> < <filename>
```

3. We can similarly send files from Windows to Linux as well.
