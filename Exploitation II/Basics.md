+ Exploitation consists of techniques and tools used by adversaries/penetration testers to gain an initial foothold on a target system or network.

+ Successful exploitation will heavily depend on the nature and quality of information gathering and service enumeration performed on the target.
	+ We can only exploit a target if we know what is vulnerable - *Unknown*

+ So far, we have covered exploitation of Windows & Linux systems both manually and automatically, however, we still need to get a clearer picture of the exploitation methodology and the tools and techniques involved in the process. 

### Penetration Testing Phases

- Identify Vulnerable Services
- Identify & Prepare Exploit Code
- Gaining Access
	+ Automated - MSF
	+ Manual
+ Obtain remote access on target system.
- Bypass AV detection
- Pivot on to other systems
