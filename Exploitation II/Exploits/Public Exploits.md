### Searching for publicly available exploits

+ After identifying a potential vulnerability within a target or a service running on a target, the next logical step will involve searching for exploit code that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.

+ Exploit code can easily be found online, however, it is important to note that downloading and running exploit code against a target can be quite dangerous. It is therefore recommended to analyze the exploit code closely to ensure that it works as intended.

+ There are a handful of legitimate and vetted exploit databases that you should use when searching for exploits online:
	+ Exploit-db
	+ Rapid7

### How to search ?

1. We can use `Exploit-DB`

2. We can use `Rapid7`

3. Using Google Dorks to search in `ExploitDB`
```
<vulnerablity-name> site:exploit-db.com
```
- We can similarly search in `Rapid7` or `Github`

4. We can use Packet Storm https://packetstormsecurity.com/ stay updated about the latest exploits and vulnerabilities that have been discovered.
