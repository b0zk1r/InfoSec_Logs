### What is `searchsploit` ?

+ In certain cases, you may not have access to online exploits and as a result, you must be able to use the exploit sources available locally/offline.

+ The entire Exploit-db database of exploits comes pre-packaged with Kali Linux, consequently providing you with all exploits locally.

+ The Exploit-db offline database of exploits can be accessed and queried with a tool called `SearchSploit`.

### How to install or use ?

1. Update and download the `exploit-db` package.
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install exploit-db -y 
```

2. Path where `exploit-db` files are stored.
```
ls -al /usr/share/exploitdb
```

3. Update the `searchsploit` database
```
searchsploit -u
```

4. Search for exploits for a particular service.
```
searchsploit <service-version>
```
- This will display the Exploit title and also the path of the exploit file saved in our system.

5. We can copy the particular exploit script to our `pwd` for easy access.
```
searchsploit -m <exploit-filename>
```

6. We can display all the exploits that exactly matches the keyword case we specify. `-c` to set it to case sensitive.  
```
searchsploit -c <service-name>
```

7. Search for keywords in a exploit title
```
searchsploit -t <keyword>
```
- We can use it to search for particular type of vulnerability, for example SQLI. 

8. Perform an exact & order match on exploit title.
```
searchsploit -e "Windows"
```

9. Searching exploits based on parameters
```
searchsploit remote windows smb
```
 
10. We can get the `exploit-db` links to the exploits
```
searchsploit remote windows smb -w | grep -e "EternalBlue"
```
