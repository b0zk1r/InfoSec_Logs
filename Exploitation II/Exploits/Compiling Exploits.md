### Compiling Exploits

+ In certain cases, exploit code will be developed in C/C++/C#, as a result, you will need to compile the exploit code in to a PE (Portable Executable) or binary.

+ Cross-Compiling is the process of compiling code for a platform other than the one performing the compilation. For example, compiling Windows exploits in Linux. 

+ As a penetration tester, you will need to have the skills necessary to compile exploit code developed in C.

### Cross compile Windows exploit code on Linux

1. In order to cross compile Windows exploits on Linux, we'll need `MinGW`.
```
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
```

2. In order to compile C code on Linux, we'll need `gcc`.
```
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

3. In our case, we'll be compiling VideoLAN VLC exploit. It's written in C. We'll search it with `searchsploit` and copy the exploit to our `pwd`.

4. We can now begin our compilation. 
```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <EDBID>.c -o <output-file>
```
- `-o` to specify the filename we want to output it as.
- If it gives no error, then it was compiled successfully.

5.  We can compile it for 32 bit systems.
```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <EDBID>.c -o <output-file> -lws2_32
```

### Compile Linux exploit code developed in C

1. We can use also use `gcc` to compile Linux exploit code developed in C. In our case, we'll be compiling the Dirty COW exploit.

2. Use `searchsploit` to look for `Dirty Cow` and copy the exploit file to our `pwd`.

3. The compilation instructions have been provided in the exploit code in case of Dirty COW. 
```
gcc -pthread <EDBID>.c -o <filename> -lcrypt
```
- If we don't get any error, then the compilation was successful.

4. We can also utilise `bin-sploits` to get access to pre-compiled binaries. 
https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb-bin-sploits. We can use this to download exploits based off on their `EDBID`.
