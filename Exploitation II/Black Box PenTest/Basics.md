### What is a Black Box Penetration Test ?

+ A Black box penetration test is a security assessment whereby the penetration tester is not provided with any information regarding the target system or network (No IP ranges, system information or default credentials are provided).

+ The objective of a Black box penetration test is to accurately test the security of a system or network as an external unprivileged adversary.

+ This approach is very useful as it demonstrates how an external attacker with no inside knowledge would compromise a company's systems or networks.
