### Using `MSF` to modify and gain access to `phpMyAdmin`

- `phpMyAdmin` is a free software tool written in PHP that is intendedÂ **to handle the administration of a MySQL or MariaDB database server**. You can use `phpMyAdmin` to perform most administration tasks, including creating a database, running queries, and adding user accounts.

- It is generally inaccessible. We'll use `MSF` to gain access to it to perform administration tasks.

### How to exploit ?

*Our target is running a Wamp Server.*

1. Gain initial access to the target. In our case, we'll be exploiting EternalBlue to gain elevated access. Elevated access is required to modify `WampServer` files.

2. The Wamp stack for Windows typically stores the web application stored on it and the config files inside `C:\\` in a folder called `wamp`.

3. We can find the application in `www` folder inside `wamp`. The `wp-config` file inside the `wordpress` folder inside it contains `MySQL` and other credentials.

4. We can modify the `phpmyadmin.conf` config file inside `C:\wamp\alias` folder which controls who gets access to `phpMyAdmin`. 

5. Download the `phpmyadmin.conf` file and modify the code to allow all users visiting the `phpMyAdmim` panel. 

6. After successfully modifying and uploading the file, we need to stop and restart the `wampapache` service. Switch to a command shell session from the `meterpreter` session.
```
net stop wampapache
```
- And then start the service again.
```
net start wampapache
```

8. Once we get access, we can modify and see the passwords of other users and the admin.

9. We can now use the admin credentials to login to the WordPress site and make changes.
