### How to enumerate in a black box penetration test ?

1. In a black box pentest in the INE course, we won't be provided with the target IP address. The target IP can be found in the `hosts` file.
```
cat /etc/hosts
```
- We should have a IP assigned to `demo.ine.local`

2. We'll now create a new folder to store all the files that are important regards to the penetration test. 

3. Firstly, we'll perform a ping scan to check if the host is up. Then, we'll perform a `nmap` service version detection scan to enumerate the services running on the target system.

4. Now we can perform a more comprehensive scan with `nmap` to further enumerate the services.
```
nmap -T4 -PA -sC -sV -p 1-10000 <ip> -oX <file-name>
```
- `-T4` - For moderately aggressive scan.
- `-PA` - TCP ACK scan.
- `-oX` - Output scan results in a XML file.

5. Now we'll start up the `postgresql` server and `msfconsole`. Create our Workspace.

6. Using `db_import` command to import the `nmap` scan results we saved earlier.
```
db_import <path-to-file>
```
