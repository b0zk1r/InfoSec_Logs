### Vulnerability scanning with `MSF`

1. Perform `nmap` scan to enumerate the target.

2. In our case, port 445 is open and running SMB. We are aware that certain versions of SMB are vulnerable to EternalBlue. 

3. We can use an auxiliary module to confirm that its vulnerable to EternalBlue.
```
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010
```

4. If vulnerable we can use an exploit module to exploit it.
```
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```
