### Vulnerability scanning with `nmap` scripts.

1. Perform a service version detection scan on the target to identify the open ports. In our case, a web server is running on port 80.

2. The `nmap` scripts are located under `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/`

3. Since we know that a http web server is running, we can `grep` HTTP `nmap` scripts.
```
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep http
```

4. Upon further analysis we discover that the target in our case is running a `.cgi` script. We can check if its vulnerable to `shellshock`.
```
nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-shellshock --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/<uri>.cgi" <target-ip>
```
- This vulnerability allows attackers to execute commands injected via malicious HTTP headers. [[ShellShock]]
