__CVE ID:__ CVE-2014-0160
__Affected software:__ OpenSSL(1.0.1)

### What does it do ?

This weakness allows stealing the information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption used to secure the Internet. 

### How does it work ?

The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.

- By manipulating the length of the data requested we can obtain extra 54 KB of data stored in the server memory.
### Using `nmap` to scan for `heartbleed`

```
nmap -p 443 --script ssl-heartbleed <target>
```
