### What is it ?

EternalBlue is both the given name to a series of Microsoft software vulnerabilities and the exploit created by the NSA as a cyberattack tool. Although the EternalBlue exploit, officially named MS17-010 by Microsoft — affects only Windows operating systems.

### How does it work ?

EternalBlue takes advantage of the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol or SMBv1 flaw in older versions of Microsoft’s operating systems. It compromises the communication between a client and server by allowing unauthorized data packets into the network. It sends malicious packets to deliver malware to the server.
