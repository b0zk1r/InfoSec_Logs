### Metasploit 

- In metasploit, after we get a meterpreter shell, we can then use the command `shell` By spawning a new shell using the `shell` command, you can access the full command-line interface and execute commands with all the capabilities and features of the native shell.

### Exploitation steps

1. Perform a service version scan using `nmap` on the target IP.
2. Use Google to know more about a particular service.
3. You might find an outdated and vulnerable service.
4. Learn more about that service using websites like `NVD
5. Look for exploits in `exploitDB` or `metasploit`.
