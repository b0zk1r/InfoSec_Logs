### CIA Triad

It is a model to describe cyber security which helps protect information and data. The three letters in "CIA triad" stand forÂ **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**.

- <u>Confidentiality</u> - This means ensuring that information is only accessible to those who have the proper authorization or permission. For example, your personal email account should only be accessible by you, not by anyone else.
- <u>Integrity</u> - It ensures that data remains unchanged and hasn't been tampered with by unauthorised individuals.
- <u>Availability</u> - This means that information and resources should be available when needed. It ensures that systems and data are accessible and usable when required. 

We balance, these three to meet business needs.

### Defence in Depth

### Risk Management

Risk management in cybersecurity is like a protective game plan to keep your digital stuff safe.

It deals with:
- Cost of securing.
- Loss in case of poor protection
- Lawsuits in case of data breach
- Loss of revenue.
