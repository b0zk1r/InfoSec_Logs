Open Redirect 01

Open Redirect vulnerabilities allows you to redirect the victim to a malicious website. They are low impact vulnerabilities in most cases unless you can use them to leak Oauth tokens.

In this challenge, you should be able to redirect the victim to a website you control (or webhook.site). Once the victim visit your page, you will get the key to score in the User-Agent. You can then submit the key.

Here it's an trivial openredirect, you can just put any URL to get the victim to your website.



Open Redirect 02


In this challenge, the redirect URL needs to start with /. The developer made the assumption that only a path/URI can start with /. However, it's possible to bypass this mechanism by using //. For this challenge, you may want to use another site than webhook.site as they don't automatically redirect http:// to https://. Otherwise, you can use the https:// URL for this exercise.
